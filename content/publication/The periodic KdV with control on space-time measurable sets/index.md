abstract: "In this paper, we establish the local exact controllability of the KdV equation on torus around equilibrium states, where both the spatial control region and the temporal control region are sets of positive measure. The proof is based on a novel strategy for proving observability inequalities on space-time measurable sets. This approach is applicable to a broad class of dispersive equations on torus."
